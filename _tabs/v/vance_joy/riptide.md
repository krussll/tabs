<span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>
<span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>

<span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
I was scared of dentists and the dark,
<span>Am</span>              <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations,
<span>Am</span>        <span>G</span>                   <span class="">C</span>
Oh all my friends are turning green,
<span>Am</span>                   <span>G</span>                  <span>C</span>
You're the magicians assistant in their dreams.


<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>   <span>C</span>
Ooh, ooh ooh
<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>        <span>C</span> (hold)
Ooh, and they come unstuck


<span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>
Lady, running down to the riptide,
<span>C</span>                 <span>Am</span>
taken away to the dark side,
<span>G</span>               <span>C</span>
I wanna be your left hand man.
<span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>                        <span>C</span>
I love you when you're singing that song and,
<span>C</span>                  <span>Am</span>
I got a lump in my throat 'cause
<span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>
you're gonna sing the words wrong


<span>Am</span>                 <span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>
There's this movie that I think you'll like,
<span>Am</span>                  <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
this guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City,
<span>Am</span>            <span>G</span>            <span>C</span>
this cowboy's running from himself.
<span>Am</span>                    <span>G</span>              <span>C</span>
And she's been living on the highest shelf

<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>   <span>C</span>
Ooh, ooh ooh
<span>Am</span>   <span>G</span>        <span>C</span> (hold)
Ooh, and they come unstuck


<span>Am</span>    <span>G</span>                   <span>C</span>

I just wanna, I just wanna know,
<span>C</span>                                <span>F</span>
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay,
<span>Am</span>                         <span>G</span>
I just gotta, I just gotta know,
<span>C</span>                                <span>F</span> 
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way


<span>Am</span>            <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
I swear she's destined for the screen,
<span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh
