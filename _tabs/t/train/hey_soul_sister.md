[Intro]

<span>C</span>     <span>G</span>                <span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>
Hey-ay, Hey-ay-AY-ay-ay, Hey-ay-AY-ay-ay


[Verse]

     <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>                         <span>Am</span>              <span>F</span>
Your lipstick stains   on the front lobe of my left side brains
                      <span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>               <span>Am</span>  <span>F</span>  <span>G</span>
I knew I wouldn't for-get you and so I went and let you blow my mind
     <span>C</span>              <span>G</span>                           <span>Am</span>               <span>F</span>
Your sweet moonbeam   the smell of you in every single dream I dream
                   <span>C</span>                              <span>G</span>                     <span>Am</span>   <span>F</span>  <span>G</span> 
I knew when we col-lided you're the one I have de-cided who's one of my kind


[Chorus]

<span>F</span>               <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>      <span>F</span>
Hey soul sister ain't that Mister Mister on the radio stereo
    <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>
The way you move aint fair you know
<span>F</span>                <span>G</span>              <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>      <span>F</span>            <span>G</span>
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do


[Bridge]

   <span>C</span>         <span>G</span>                <span>Am</span>               <span>F</span>

             <span>C</span>                           <span>G</span>                          <span>Am</span>

Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do
   <span>C</span>
To-night


[Verse]

   <span>C</span>
The way you can't cut a rug
<span>G</span>                              <span>Am</span>
Watching you's the only drug I need
         
You're so gangster I'm so thug
           <span>F</span>                            <span>C</span>
You're the only one I'm dreaming of you see
                          <span>G</span>
I can be myself now final-ly
                                <span>Am</span>
In fact there's nothing I can't be
                            <span>F</span>       <span>G</span>
I want the world to see you be with   me


[Chorus]

<span>F</span>               <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>      <span>F</span>
Hey soul sister ain't that Mister Mister on the radio stereo
    <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>
The way you move aint fair you know
<span>F</span>               <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>      <span>F</span>               <span>G</span>
Hey soul sister I don't want to miss a single thing you do to-night
<span>F</span>               <span>G</span>               <span>C</span>      <span>G</span>      <span>F</span>              <span>G</span>
