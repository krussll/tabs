     <span>C</span>
Well you done done me, and you bet I felt it
 <span>G</span>
I tried to be chill, but you're so hot that I melted
   <span>Am</span>
I fell right through the cracks
             <span>F</span>
And now I'm trying to get back
           <span>C</span>
Before the cool done run out I'll be givin' it my bestest
     <span>G</span>
And nothing's gonna stop me but divine intervention
   <span>Am</span>
I reckon it's again my turn
    <span>F</span>
To win some or learn some


    <span>C</span>           <span>G</span>
But I won't hesitate
              <span>Am</span>
No more, no more
            <span>F</span>
It cannot wait
       <span>C</span>
I'm yours


<span>G</span> - <span>Am</span> - <span>F</span> - <span>C</span>


<span>C</span>                            <span>G</span>
Open up you mind and see like me
(G)                                Am
Open up your plans and damn you're free
(Am)
Look into your heart and you'll find
<span>F</span>
Love, love, love, love
<span>C</span>                                                  <span>G</span>
Listen to the music of the moment people dance and sing
(G)                  Am
We're just one big family
(Am)
And it's our godforsaken right to be
<span>F</span>
Loved, loved, loved, loved
<span>D7</span>
Loved


<span>C</span>              <span>G</span>
So I won't hesitate
         <span>Am</span>
No more, no more
          <span>F</span>
It cannot wait
(F)
I'm sure

<span>C</span>                         <span>G</span>
There's no need to complicate our time
<span>Am</span>
Is sure
             <span>F</span>
This is our fate
           <span>C</span>  <span>G</span>
I'm yours

<span>Am</span>
Did you want to come on
<span>F</span>
Sit a little closer dear
<span>F</span>                      <span>D</span>
And I will nibble your ear


<span>C</span> - <span>G</span> - <span>Am</span> - <span>F</span> - <span>D</span> - <span>F</span> 


                <span>C</span>
I've been spending way too long
<span>C</span>
Checking my tongue in the mirror
    <span>G</span>
And bending over backwards just to try to see it clearer
    <span>Am</span>
But my breath fogged up the glass
         <span>F</span>
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
  <span>C</span>
I guess what I be saying is there ain't no better reason
    <span>G</span>
To rid yourself of vanity and just go with the seasons
     <span>Am</span>
It's what we aim to do
     <span>F</span>
Our name is our virtue


     <span>C</span>          <span>G</span>
But I won't hesitate
           <span>Am</span>
No more, no more,
          <span>F</span>
It cannot wait
<span>F</span>
I'm yours


<span>C</span>                               <span>G</span>
Open up  your mind and see like me
(G)                               Am
Open up your plans and damn you're free
(Am)
Look into your heart and you'll find
<span>F</span>
The sky is yours
<span>C</span>
So please don't please don't please don't


           <span>G</span>
There's no need to complicate
          <span>Am</span>
Cause our time is sure
                              <span>F</span>
This, oh this, oh this is our fate
          <span>D</span>
I'm yours

N.C.                    C     G   Am  F (until faded)
Ah, ba ba dum ba ba dum eyyy...</pre>
