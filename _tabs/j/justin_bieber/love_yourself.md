              <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>         <span>Am</span>
For all the times that you rain on my parade
              <span>F</span>                <span class="">Am</span>          <span>G</span>
And all the clubs you get in using my name
               <span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>                  <span>Am</span> 
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness' sake
                <span>F</span>          <span>Am</span>                <span>G</span>
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't


                    <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>              <span>F</span>
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
    <span>F</span>          <span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
               <span>Am</span>      <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
<span>F</span>               <span>F</span>          <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
               <span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
             <span>F</span>       <span>G</span>                    <span>C</span>
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>               <span>F</span>
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
           <span>F</span>                 <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


              <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>       <span>Am</span>       <span>F</span>
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        <span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
             <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>          <span>Am</span>     <span>F</span>
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
<span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
You should go and love yourself


              <span>C</span>                <span>G</span>        <span>Am</span>
But when you told me that you hated my friends
          <span>F</span>                <span>Am</span>             <span>G</span>
The only problem was with you and not them
           <span>C</span>               <span>G</span>           <span>Am</span>
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
             <span>F</span>               <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>
And tried to make me forget where I came from


                    <span>Am</span>         <span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>              <span>F</span>
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
   <span>F</span>           <span>G</span>                     <span>C</span>
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
               <span>Am</span>      <span>G</span>                 <span>C</span>
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'
<span>F</span>               <span>F</span>          <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that
               <span>Am</span>           <span>G</span>                <span>C</span>
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
             <span>F</span>       <span>G</span>                    <span>C</span>
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
                 <span>Am</span>               <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>               <span>F</span>
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
           <span>F</span>                 <span>C</span>             <span>G</span>
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


              <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>       <span>Am</span>       <span>F</span>
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        <span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
             <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>          <span>Am</span>     <span>F</span>
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
<span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
You should go and love yourself


             <span>C</span>                      <span>G</span>         <span>Am</span>
For all the times that you made me feel small
           <span>F</span>                <span>Am</span>            <span>G</span>
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all
         <span>C</span>           <span>G</span>                   <span>Am</span>
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
         <span>F</span>               <span>Am</span>                 <span>G</span>
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?


              <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>       <span>Am</span>       <span>F</span>
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        <span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
             <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>          <span>Am</span>     <span>F</span>
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
<span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
You should go and love yourself
              <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>       <span>Am</span>       <span>F</span>
Cause if you like the way you look that much
        <span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
             <span>C</span>        <span>G</span>          <span>Am</span>     <span>F</span>

<span>C</span>                  <span>G</span>           <span>C</span>
You should go and love yourself
