[Intro]

<span>C</span> <span>G</span> <span>Am</span> <span class="">C</span> <span>G</span>
 
[Verse 1]

<span>C</span>    <span>Em</span>  <span class="">Am</span>        <span>F</span>     <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>
Wise men say, only fools rush in
    <span>F</span> <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>   <span>F</span>          <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
but I can't help falling in love with you

<span>C</span>     <span>Em</span> <span class="">Am</span>             <span>F</span>  <span>C</span> <span>G</span>
Shall I  stay, would it be a sin?
   <span>F</span> <span>G</span>     <span class="">Am</span>   <span>F</span>          <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
If I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]

<span>Em</span>           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>            <span>B7</span>
Like a river flows surely to the sea
<span>Em</span>            <span>B7</span>
Darling so it goes
<span>Em</span>          <span>A7</span>           <span>Dm</span>  <span>G</span>
some things are meant to be

[Verse 2]

<span>C</span>    <span>Em</span> <span>Am</span>            <span>F</span>     <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>
Take my hand, take my whole life too
    <span>F</span> <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>   <span>F</span>          <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
for I can't help falling in love with you

[Chorus]

<span>Em</span>           <span>B7</span>    <span>Em</span>            <span>B7</span>
Like a river flows surely to the sea
<span>Em</span>            <span>B7</span>
Darling so it goes
<span>Em</span>          <span>A7</span>           <span>Dm</span>  <span>G</span>
some things are meant to be

[Verse 3]

<span>C</span>    <span>Em</span> <span>Am</span>            <span>F</span>     <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>
Take my hand, take my whole life too
    <span>F</span> <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>   <span>F</span>          <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
for I can't help falling in love with you
    <span>F</span> <span>G</span>     <span>Am</span>   <span>F</span>          <span>C</span>    <span>G</span>    <span>C</span>
for I can't help falling in love with you
